# PETSTEP
Positron Emission Tomography Simulator of Tracers via Emission Projection

This application is written in Matlab and designed as a plugin for CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) also in Github under an GNU GPL license.  https://github.com/adityaapte/CERR

PETSTEP is a fast PET simulator designed for high throughput simulation of PET images.  It allows a full simulation of a user defined activity distributions (objects) or the insertion of realistic user defined tumors into exisiting patients.  Both patient and objects must be in dicom format loaded in CERR.  

This tool is described in Berthon, Beatrice, et al. "PETSTEP: Generation of synthetic PET lesions for fast evaluation of segmentation methods." Physica Medica 31.8 (2015): 969-980.
